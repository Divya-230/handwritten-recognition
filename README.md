Handwritten Digit Recognition 

📌 Overview
This project uses classical Machine Learning algorithms to recognize handwritten digits from image data.
The goal is to build an accurate classifier using preprocessing, feature extraction, and model evaluation.

🚀 Features
- Image preprocessing (flattening, normalization)
- Model training with XGBoost, SVM, Random Forest, etc.
- Train–test split and cross-validation
- Confusion matrix and accuracy evaluation
- Prediction on custom handwritten digits

🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python  
- NumPy  
- Pandas  
- Scikit-learn  
- XGBoost  
- Matplotlib
